* Pirouette

A (hopefully) small overabstracted oversimplified PHP framework that removes most* the PHP boilerplate such as dealing with superglobals and whatnot.

Currently in development, use at own risk.

** To Do:
*** Controller [20%]
+ [X] Basic routing
+ [ ] Regex-support
+ [ ] get/post/put/delete methods
+ [ ] options method
+ [ ] user's means of implementing HTTP methods etc
*** Model
+ [ ] ORM via [[https://www.redbeanphp.com/index.php][RedBeanPHP]]
*** View
+ [ ] Templates via [[http://mustache.github.io][Mustache]]

** Inspired by:

+ Sinatra
+ Camping
